                        Wealth. Fame. Power. Gol D. Roger, the king of the
                        pirates attained this and everything else the
                        world had to offer and his dying words drove countless
                        souls to the seas. "You want my treasure? You
                        can have it! I left everything I gathered together in
                        one place now you just have to find it."
                        These words lured men to the grand line in pursuit of
                        dreams greater than they'd ever dared to imagine. This
                        is the time known as the great pirate era.
                    </p>

                    <p>Roger was the first pirate since Joy Boy to sail all the
                        way around the Grand Line, ultimately reaching its final
                        island, which he named Laugh Tale. Aware that he was
                        dying from an incurable illness, he disbanded his crew
                        and surrendered himself to be executed. Although the
                        World Government staged his execution as a warning to
                        deter piracy, Roger’s final words had the opposite
                        effect, declaring that the One Piece was up for anyone
                        who could find it, thereby sparking the Great Pirate
                        Era.</p>

                    <p>
                        Let us look at an excerpt from a hit song from the
                        legendary Playboi Carti called 'EVIL J0RDAN'. "First, I
                        go whip out the boat, no, I can't hit on no brakes. My
                        life is out of control, I'm tellin' you,
                        nobody safe. I've been livin' my life limbo, my ice, it
                        came with a tray. I'm so fly, I gotta hide my
                        face, this not a rockstar phase. I'm a emo thug in my
                        faith. Syrup, syrup, syrup, syrup, tell them to go
                        change. Monkey nuts on me, baby, I got on two chains."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “EVIL J0RDAN” by Playboi Carti, from his album MUSIC,
                        combines chaotic trap beats with eerie, synth-heavy
                        atmospheres, offering a glimpse into Carti’s largely
                        unseen lifestyle. The track opens with a futuristic yet
                        retro soundscape that draws listeners into his dark,
                        distorted world, quickly building into an intense,
                        almost manic trap rhythm that matches his raw energy.
                        The title refers to Carti’s birth name, Jordan, with the
                        “O” replaced by a zero as a nod to his Opium label.
                        “EVIL” reflects his portrayed persona and may also
                        reference the YVL movement. The song’s backstory, teased
                        on Instagram and enhanced by DJ Swamp Izzo’s haunting
                        narration, adds to its rebellious feel, while Carti’s
                        cousin Kee revealed it was recorded in a single night,
                        emphasizing its spontaneous creation. Despite the rapid
                        production, the track remains cohesive, blending classic
                        trap with an unsettling emo-thug aesthetic unique to
                        Carti.</p>
